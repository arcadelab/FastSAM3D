## Overview

FastSAM3D is an efficient "Segment Anything Model" (SAM) designed for 3D volumetric medical images, aiming to achieve zero-shot generalization capability through interactive cues. The model significantly reduces inference time and computational cost through a novel layer-by-layer asymptotic distillation method and a 3D sparse lightning attention mechanism. FastSAM3D achieves inference on 128x128x128 volumetric images within 8 ms on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, which is 527.38x faster compared to 2D SAMs, and 8.75x faster than 3D SAMs while maintaining no significant performance degradation.

## Features

- **High-Speed Inference**: Achieves rapid inference on 128x128x128 volumetric images in just 8 milliseconds when using an NVIDIA A100 GPU.
- **Cutting-Edge Model Efficiency**: Utilizes layer-wise progressive distillation to transfer knowledge from a 12-layer ViT-B to a more compact 6-layer ViT-Tiny, reducing model complexity without sacrificing performance.
- **Robust Performance**: Delivers competitive Dice scores across diverse datasets, demonstrating reliable segmentation results that are consistent with more computationally intensive models.
- **Interactivity**: Designed for interactive use, FastSAM3D allows for iterative user input to refine segmentation outputs, enhancing user engagement and control over the segmentation process.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Dramatically cuts down on computational costs with reduced FLOPs and memory usage, offering a significant speedup of 527.38× over 2D SAMs and 8.75× over 3D SAMs.

###  Installation

<h4>From <code>source</code></h4>

> 1. Clone the FastSAM3D-v1 repository:
>
> ```console
> $ git clone https://github.com/skill-diver/FastSAM3D-v1
> ```
>
> 2. Change to the project directory:
> ```console

> ```

###  Usage

<h4>From <code>source</code></h4>

> 1. **Train the Teacher Model and Prepare Labels**
>
>    Use the command below to train the teacher model and prepare labels for guided distillation to the student model, and put your data and checkpoint in the corresponding position of the shell script:
>    ```console
>    $ ./preparelabel.sh
>    ```
>
> 3. **Distill the Model**
>
>    To distill the model, run the following command. The distilled checkpoint will be stored in `work_dir`, and put your data and checkpoint in the corresponding position of shell script:
>    ```console
>    $ ./distillation.sh
>
>    ```
>
> 5. **Validate the Teacher Model**
>
>    Validate the teacher model using the command below, and put your data and checkpoint in the corresponding position of shell script:
>    ```console
>    $ ./infer.sh
>    ```
>
> 7. **Validate the Student Model**
>
>    Finally, to validate the student model after distillation, and put your data and checkpoint in the corresponding position of the shell script:
>    ```console
>    $ ./validation_student.sh
>    ```
